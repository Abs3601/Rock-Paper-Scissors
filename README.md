# Rock-Paper-Scissors

I forgot to commit this until i finished the 5 rounds.

I think the randomness of it isn't the best, I believe that could be done a lot better.

I do think its really cool though how I was able to do this on my own (with resources). It took me ages to figure out how to use math.random to randomly return a value lol.

This is probably not very well made and can be made a lot more concise, however, I made it and I think thats cool.
